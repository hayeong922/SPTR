"Alloy steel","A steel in which a deliberate addition of one or more alloying elements, e.g. Mn, Ni, Cr, Mo etc has been made during steel making to enhance the properties of the steel.  The amounts of each element that must be present in steel before it is classified as an alloy steel are given in Table 1 in BS EN 10020: 1998.  At low levels of addition the steels may be classified as micro or low alloy.  The same standard classifies steels that do not meet the minimum requirements as ‘non-alloy’ steels."
"Alpha-Iron","The form of iron (also referred to as ferrite) that exists naturally below 910°C in which the iron atoms are arranged in a body centred cubic (bcc) crystalline pattern, i.e. an iron atom at each corner of a cube and a single one right in the middle of the cube."
"Anisotropy","Anisotropy is the word used to describe the fact materials in general, and steels in particular, are characterised by mechanical properties that differ depending upon the direction in which they are assessed.  Particular use is made of this in cold reduced formable steels intended for deep drawing applications; the production process route is such as to enhance this particular property, which is given a numerical value by a parameter known as the ‘r’ value."
"Annealing","A heat treatment that involves heating the steel to a pre-determined temperature, soaking the steel at that temperature for a pre-determined time and then cooling the steel down under controlled conditions.  After being annealed steel will be closer to its equilibrium state.  The temperature used can depend upon the chemical composition and the initial state of the steel and on the outcome desired of the treatment.  This requirement of the treatment gives rise to the terms: stress-relief annealing, recrystallisation annealing, spheroidisation annealing and full annealing."
"Arc furnace","A melting unit in which the heat is generated by striking an arc between graphite electrodes and the metal charge, which is usually in the form of solid scrap."
"Arriss","Removal of sharp edges / corners in preparation for painting."
"Austempering","A heat treatment process in which the steel is quenched from high temperature, when it is austenitic, to a temperature just above the austenite to martensite transformation temperature of the steel.  The steel is then held at this temperature until it has transformed completely to bainite.  It is then quenched to room temperature."
"Austenite","A solid solution of one or more elements in gamma iron. (q.v.)"
"Austenitic steels","These are steels that contain sufficient austenite stabilising elements, such as Mn, Ni and N, so that the microstructure of the steel is austenitic at room temperature.  Such steels cannot be quench or air hardened but will work harden rapidly; they are non-magnetic.  Important examples of austenitic steels are 18/8 (18% Cr, 8% Ni) stainless steel and Hadfield’s Manganese (14% Mn) rail steel."
"Bainite","An acicular aggregate of ferrite and carbide particles formed when austenite is transformed on cooling at temperatures in the intermediate (200-450°C) range, i.e. above the martensite and below the pearlite range."
"Bake hardenable steel","Bake hardenable steels are so constituted that after press forming and stoving (baking) through the paint curing process they age, i.e. they increase in strength.  In this way, good formability is combined with added stiffness in the finished component, which frequently is an automotive body panel in which enhanced dent resistance is a desirable attitude."
"Balanced steel","This is made by controlling the oxygen content of the liquid steel prior to ingot casting so that the amount of gas evolved during solidification balances the contraction, so minimising the formation of pipe.  (NB.  The majority of steels are now produced via the ConCast route.)"
"Basic oxygen steel making","Basic oxygen steel making is the process by which molten iron from a blast furnace is refined by the near total removal of carbon, silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur to a point from which, by the addition of appropriate ferro-alloys and aluminium, the required grade of steel can be made.  The process involves the injection of high volumes of oxygen at very high pressure into a vessel which originally will have contained a charge comprising approximately 20% selected ferrous scrap and 80% molten iron.  The refractory lining of the vessel is basic, as opposed to acidic in nature, and basic fluxes are also added with the aim of creating a slag into which the impurities are driven.  The capacity of vessels is very variable, but typically can range from around 200 tonnes to in excess of 350 tonnes.  A cast of steel can be produced in less than 20 minutes.  With modern refractories, a vessel is expected to be capable of producing in excess of 1000 heats before it needs to be relined."
"Batching","The grouping together of parts to achieve an economic use of the process."
"Bend test","A form of mechanical testing used to assess the ductility of a piece of steel.  In carrying out such a test it will often be necessary to follow a detailed procedure which may cover the form, selection and preparation of the test specimen and exactly how the specimen is to be bent and the result assessed and reported, e.g. see BS1639: 1964.  The results are normally expressed as a minimum bend diameter in the form nT, where n is a number (sometimes a decimal fraction), and T is the thickness of the steel."
"Billet","A semi-finished long product, sometimes of rectangular but more usually of square cross-section, with radiused corners.  It can be produced from the hot rolling of a bloom, which has in turn been hot-rolled from ingot stock, or it can be produced directly by continuous casting.  Square billet has sides between 50-120mm, whereas rectangular billet has a cross-sectional area between 2500 and 14400mm2 and has a width to thickness ratio greater than 1:1 and less than 2:1.  In practice, sizes up to 160mm square are often referred to as billet."
"Bismuth","Added at a level of 0.1-0.2% as a direct replacement for lead, (it is more expensive, but there are not the toxicity problems associated with making lead additions), or at a lower level of 0.05-0.1% in combinations with sulphur, lead and tellurium, to improve the machinability of steel."
"Blast furnace","A tall, 60-70m high, refractory lined furnace of circular cross-section (diameter at the base – 12m) from the bottom of which liquid cast pig iron it tapped periodically.  This is produced by feeding in a solid mixture of iron ore, limestone and coke at the top and by blowing in pre-heated air, and usually fuel, at the bottom."
"Bloom","A semi-finished long product, sometimes of rectangular but more generally of square cross-section, with radiused corners.   It can be produced form the hot rolling of ingot stock or by continuous casting.  Its size is larger than that of billet; a square bloom has sides generally greater than 120mm, whereas a rectangular bloom has a cross-sectional area greater than 14400mm2 and has a ratio of width to thickness greater than 1:1 and less than 2:1."
"Boron steels","Steels that contain additions of boron, generally between 0.002-0.003%, which is added to increase the hardenability of the steel."
"Brazing","A method for joining steel parts together by melting a layer of a lower melting point alloy, usually brass, between the adjoining steel surfaces.  The heat used is not sufficient to melt the steel and a flux is used to ensure flow of the brazing alloy between the steel surfaces."
"Bright annealing","An annealing heat treatment carried out using either a specially controlled atmosphere or a vacuum, thus preventing oxidation and so keeping the surface of the steel being heat-treated bright and shiny."
"Bright drawing","The process of drawing steel, which is initially at room temperature, in bar or coil form through a die in order to produce a product close dimensional tolerances, with changed mechanical properties and a bright surface finish.  Prior to the drawing operation the steel surface may need to be prepared by pickling or shot blasting in order to produce a satisfactory initial surface condition."
"Brinell hardness test","A test in which a hardened steel ball, usually 10mm in diameter, is pressed into the surface of the steel for a set time using a load of 3000kgf.  The steel ball indenter is then removed and the diameter of the indentation is measured and used to determine the Brinell Hardness Number, HB, of the steel by reference to standard tables."
"Calcium","Aluminium – killed steel, while in the ladle prior to being cast, often has calcium, in the form of calcium silicide, injected into the liquid bath.  The addition of calcium lowers the level of the remaining oxygen and sulphur contents of the steel and modifies the residual inclusion composition and shape.  This has the effect of improving the cleanliness and castability and of reducing the anisotropy of toughness and ductility of the steel produced."
"Carbides","Carbides are chemical compounds comprising carbon and either single metallic elements, or more complex combinations of more than one metallic element.  The simplest example is iron carbide that is always present in steels.  Provided carbides are present in the correct form, i.e. with regard to size and dispersion, they are beneficial.  Particular use is made of carbides, (or the more complex carbonitrides, which include nitrogen) in high strength low alloy (HSLA) steels.  A proportion of the increased strength of these materials is due to the effects which e.g. niobium carbide precipitates have on the structure of the product."
"Carbon","An essential alloying addition in steel.  As the carbon content of steel increases so does the strength and hardness.  To optimise the ductility and toughness for a given strength level the steel would be quenched and tempered.  The majority of carbon would then be in the form of fine carbides.  Carbon besides increasing the strength and hardness also increases hardenability (q.v.).  In general, the higher the carbon content, the greater the care required in welding.  (See Carbon Equivalent.)"
"Carbon equivalent","A key parameter in assessing the weldability of a steel grade.  The higher the value, the greater the care needed, especially with regard to pre- and post- heat treatment."

"Carbonitriding","A thermochemical method of surface hardening a steel in which the steel is heated into the austenitic region and carbon and nitrogen diffused into the steel surface, following which, the steel is quenched."
"Carburising","A thermochemical process in which steel is heated into the austenitic region in a carbon-rich atmosphere, so causing carbon to diffuse into the steel surface.  The carburised steel product is then quenched."
"Case-Hardening","A process in which the surface (case) of the steel is hardened and the interior (core) of the steel is left unchanged.  A number of different techniques are available for achieving this objective."
"Cast iron","Cast Iron differs from steel in that is has a much higher carbon content, 2.0-4.5%, in combination with amounts of silicon, manganese, phosphorus and sulphur as determined by the type of cast iron, and the end use."
"Cementite","This is the name given to the compound of iron and carbon, Fe3C (iron carbide – colloquially ‘carbides’), which is a microstructural constituent found in many steels.  It is very hard and brittle."
"Charpy test","A test used to determine the degree of toughness of a steel.  A standard Charpy test specimen is 10mm square in cross-section, 55mm long and has a V-notch machined in it at mid-length.  The specimen is supported in a machine in which it is fractured by a swinging pendulum.  The energy absorbed in fracturing the specimen in Joules (J) is read from a scale on the instrument, and is a measure of the toughness of the steel being tested.  (See BS EN 10045-1: 1990)."
"Chromium","Added to increase the hardenability of steel.  A strong carbide former, so is present in quenched and tempered engineering steels, up to 3.5%, ball bearing steel, 1-1.5%, tool steels, (up to 12% in cold-working die steel) and in creep and heat resisting steels.  When steels contain 11% or more of chromium they are termed stainless because of their corrosion resistance, which is due to the thin passive chromium-rich oxide film, which forms on the steel surface."

"Cold drawing","A process in which steel, in the form for example of bard, rod, tube, section or wire, is reduced in cross-sectional area and so increased in length by being pulled through a die.  Initially, the steel is at room temperature but the reduction process may cause a noticeable increase in the temperature of the drawn steel.  Cold drawing increases strength but reduces ductility and toughness."
"Cold reduced","See ‘Cold Rolled’."
"Cold rolled","The term cold rolled is used to describe materials that have been rolled at a temperature below the so-called recrystallisation temperature.  As a result of cold rolling the product is extremely hard, and in the great majority of cases it is necessary to anneal it before it has any commercial value.  The product so produced is characterised by a good surface and enhanced thickness tolerances.  Such a product is referred to as ‘cold reduced’."

Creep tests involve the determination of the strain-time curve for the steel under constant stress and constant temperature conditions."
"Critical cooling rate","The minimum rate of cooling that will produce a fully martensitic microstructure in a steel when it is cooled from austenitic condition to room temperature.  As the alloy content and carbon content of steel is increased the critical cooling rate of the steel decreases."
"Critical temperature","The temperature at which a phase change occurs in steel.  The exact value of this temperature depends on the particular phase change occurring e.g. austenite to ferrite or cementite or the reverse, on the chemical composition of the steel, on whether the steel is being heated or cooled and on the rate of heating or cooling."
"Crystalline fracture","When this type of fracture occurs in a steel it will have a shiny appearance as the fracture path in each grain has followed a cleavage plane so producing in each grain a flat reflective surface."
"CTCD","Inspection technique on formed material."
"Cyanide hardening","A surface hardening treatment in which low-carbon steel is immersed in a bath of molten cyanide-based salt causing carbon and nitrogen to diffuse into the steel surface so enabling a hardened case to be produced on the steel when it is quenched from the salt bath."

Elements added for this purpose are Si and Al.  Modern casting practice requires the complete removal of gaseous oxygen before casting commences; this steel is ‘fully killed’."
"Descaling","A process in which oxide (scale), formed on steel when it is at high temperature in an oxidising environment, is removed from the steel surface.  Primary scale is usually removed in the first stage of a hot working operation using high-pressure water jets whereas secondary scale is usually removed by hot acid pickling or by shot blasting."

They are supplied in the cold rolled sheet or strip form, annealed and with an insulating coating on one, or both, faces of the sheet.  They can be of a non-oriented grain type, in which case their magnetic properties are similar both in the direction of rolling and in the transverse direction, or a grain oriented type, in which case the steel has preferred magnetic properties in the rolling direction.  Typically, a steel of the latter type contains &gt;3% Si, and Mn in the range 0.05-0.07%."
"Electroslag refining","A process for refining metallic alloys in which the alloy, in the wrought or as-cast state, in the form of an electrode is remelted through flux (slag) and solidified within a water-cooled copper mould."

"End quench test","This is more commonly referred to as the JOMINY test.  This test used to determine the relative hardenability of a steel.  The test piece is heated into the austenitic range, and then subjected to quenching from just one end, after which the hardness is determined incrementally away from the quenched end."

"Extrusion","The production of a length of uniform cross-section of metal from billet or ingot stock by forcing the metal to flow through a die, in direct extrusion, or to flow through or around the ram (die) in backward extrusion.  In both cases, the finished section will have a smaller cross-sectional area than the starting material and therefore will be longer."
"Fatigue","The effect on a metal of repeated cycles of stress.  If these changes in stress are of sufficient magnitude and number the metal can fracture at a stress level considerably below that of its tensile strength."
"Fatigue limit","The maximum value of the applied alternating stress that the material can withstand without failure ever occurring."

"Galvanic action","Corrosion induced by the action of an electric current caused to flow when two metals of dissimilar composition are connected electrically by an electrolyte.  The metal higher in the galvanic series will act as cathode, while the other will act as anode and will therefore corrode."
"Galvanising","Galvanising is the process in which corrosion protection is provided to a steel product by coating it in zinc.  This can be achieved either through a hot dip process, or electrolytically.  In the former, a cold reduced product passes through a series of heat treatments in which it is annealed and the surface is cleaned prior to the strip being passed continuously into a bath of molten zinc at c.440°C.  The coating mass is controlled as a result of the strip then passed through a set of air (or nitrogen) knives which force surplus zinc back into the bath.  The action of these knives is controlled by a meter that is set according to the coating mass actually required.  The alternative method of coating is to do it electrolytically; in this case the feedstock is an annealed and temper rolled cold reduced product.  Generally speaking, the coating masses so applied are much lighter than by hot dipping.  It should be remembered that in addition to the continuous processes described above, for some applications post galvanising, i.e. hot dip galvanising alter forming or fabrication, is appropriate.   If steels are to be post-galvanised as part of the manufacturing process this should be stated at the time of ordering."
"Galvanneal","A variation of the continuous hot dip galvanising process.  Following the solidification of the strip on exit form the galvanising bath it is passed through another furnace in which the iron and zinc are caused to alloy (8-12% iron) more strongly than can be achieved purely by dipping.  This product is used in the automotive industry where good corrosion resistance is combined with much improved weldability compared with a pure zinc coating."

"Hardenability","A term applied to steels to describe the relative ease with which martensite can be formed in the steel.  The lower the cooling rate at which a fully martensitic microstructure can be formed in the steel when it is cooled from austenitic condition the higher is the hardenability.  Hardenability is commonly assessed by the Jominy end quench test."
"Hardening","Increasing the hardness of metals by mechanical, thermo-mechanical, thermal or thermo-chemical treatments."
"Hardness","A measure of the resistance of a metal to indentation by a loaded indenter.  The common tests used to determine hardness are the Vickers, Brinell or Rockwell tests."
"Heat","In steel making this is often used to describe the steel produced from a single melting operation."
"Heat resisting steel","These are steels required to operate at very high temperatures and therefore they may require one or more of the following characteristics: creep resistance, resistance to oxidation, or other forms of gaseous attack, and freedom from microstructural changes that would lead to their embrittlement.  Because service conditions can vary greatly a wide range of steel compositions came under the category of heat resisting with C-Mn, or low alloy steels of the CR Mo-V type being used to 500-525°C and austenitic stainless grades, containing for example 25% Cr, 20% Ni, being used at higher temperatures."

"Intercrystalline corrosion","Corrosive attack occurring preferentially in the grain boundary regions of an alloy.  It is also known as intergranular corrosion."
"Interrupted quenching","A term used to describe a quenching procedure in which steel, instead of being quenched into a liquid at ambient temperature, is quenched into a liquid, usually molten salt, at some elevated temperature.  When the steel has been held for sufficient time at this temperature to achieve temperature uniformity, and/or has achieved the required microstructural transformation, it is further quenched to room temperature."
"Iron","When used in the scientific or chemical sense this word refers to the chemical element Fe or to pure iron.  It is the principal element present in steels and cast irons."
"Izod impact test","An Izod impact test is similar to a Charpy test in that the notched specimen is of the same dimensions as a Charpy test piece and the energy absorbed when the specimen is fractured by a falling pendulum is used to assess the toughness of the steel sample.  In the Izod test the specimen is struck by the pendulum when it is held vertically in a vice, whereas in the Charpy test the specimen is struck when in a horizontal position."

"Lap","The presence of an area of 'double skin' on the surface of a wrought steel product, e.g. on a section of rolled bar. The most common cause of this type of defect is from excess material being squeezed out into the roll collar during a roll pass so forming a fin on either side of the product. On turning the steel for the next pass the fins are then rolled back into the steel surface so producing laps."
"Laser cutting and welding","Laser cutting is a process in which a laser beam is used to cut e.g. blanks from a sheet of metal. Because of the intense and highly localised nature of a laser beam, a high degree of precision can be achieved. Provided the material being cut is of adequate quality, the risk of distortion is greatly reduced. The cut is much cleaner than one produced by any other means. Laser welding is the reverse of cutting; in this case the intense heat of a laser beam is being used to execute a precision weld of high quality."

It is used in some grades of austenitic stainless steel to replace the more expensive nickel, as it is an austenite stabiliser."
"Maraging steels","Maraging steels are a family of high nickel steels i.e. typically not less than 18% that are characterised by extreme high strength and toughness. Nickel is one of a group of possible additions to steel that encourages the formation of austenite, as opposed to carbides. Because of this, under the correct conditions high strength can be conferred by the transformation of austenite into martensitic type structures. The merit of maraging steels is that this change brought about as a result of a simple heat treatment, a consequence of which is that the problems of distortion normally associated with high temperature heat treatments are avoided. A typical heat treatment might involve heating o 820°C followed by air cooling (which avoids the distortion which would be associated with a faster rate cooling). The process is completed by ageing at a temperature in the range 450-510°C n"
"Martempering","A heat transformation procedure in which an austenitised steel is quenched to a temperature just above MS, the martensite start temperature, at a rate fast enough to avoid the formation of ferrite, pearlite or bainite.
